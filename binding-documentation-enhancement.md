# Binding Documentation Enhancement

## What was missing

The tldraw documentation had an incomplete section about bindings in the Editor documentation (`apps/docs/content/docs/editor.mdx`). The Bindings section:

1. **Explained the concept** of bindings well - what they are and how they work conceptually
2. **Showed the binding object structure** with a good JSON example
3. **Started explaining custom bindings** with a basic type definition
4. **Had an incomplete BindingUtil example** that cut off mid-sentence and only showed:
   - Basic class structure
   - `getDefaultProps()` method
   - An incomplete `onAfterChangeToShape()` method with just a comment

## What was needed

The documentation needed a **complete, working example** that shows developers how to:

- Define a custom binding type with proper TypeScript types
- Implement a complete `BindingUtil` class with all necessary methods
- Handle binding lifecycle events (shape changes, deletions)
- Work with coordinate transformations between different spaces
- Create shapes that can participate in bindings
- Integrate everything together in a working application

## What I added

I completed the Bindings section by adding a comprehensive **"Complete binding example"** that demonstrates a "magnet" binding system where magnet shapes stick to other shapes and follow them around.

### The example includes:

#### Step 1: Binding Type Definition
- Complete TypeScript type definition using `TLBaseBinding`
- Proper props structure with anchor points and offsets
- Clear comments explaining each property

#### Step 2: Complete BindingUtil Implementation
- Full `MagnetBindingUtil` class extending `BindingUtil`
- `getDefaultProps()` method with sensible defaults
- `onAfterChangeToShape()` method that handles target shape changes
- `onBeforeDeleteToShape()` method that handles cleanup
- Proper coordinate transformations between different spaces
- Real implementation that calculates positions and updates shapes

#### Step 3: Companion Shape Implementation
- `MagnetShape` type definition
- Complete `MagnetShapeUtil` class
- Shape rendering with visual feedback
- `onTranslateEnd()` method that creates/updates bindings
- Proper binding creation with anchor point calculations

#### Step 4: Integration Example
- Complete React component showing how to use the binding
- Proper setup with `shapeUtils` and `bindingUtils`
- Demonstration setup with sample shapes

### Key concepts demonstrated:

- **Binding lifecycle management**: How bindings respond to shape changes and deletions
- **Coordinate transformations**: Converting between page, shape, and parent coordinate spaces
- **Anchor points**: Using normalized coordinates (0-1) to attach to specific points on shapes
- **Binding creation and cleanup**: When and how to create/delete bindings
- **Integration patterns**: How to combine custom shapes with custom bindings

## Impact

This enhancement transforms the bindings documentation from an incomplete stub into a comprehensive guide that developers can follow to implement their own custom binding systems. The example is realistic, complete, and demonstrates all the key concepts needed to build production-ready binding functionality.
