Create a custom shape for typing out math notation, using the MathLive library.

This example shows how you might create a custom shape that lets the user type out math notation. It uses the [MathLive](https://github.com/arnog/mathlive) library for this.

Create more math shapes by using the math tool, which you can select from the far-left of the toolbar. Double click on a math shape to start editing it.
