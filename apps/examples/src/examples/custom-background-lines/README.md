Add custom lined paper background for writing.

---

This example demonstrates how to create a custom background component that displays horizontal lines, similar to lined paper for writing. The lines are drawn using a 2D canvas context and automatically adjust to the camera position and zoom level.

The custom background replaces the default tldraw background component and provides a writing-friendly surface with evenly spaced horizontal lines.
