You've now joined tldraw to help write technical content, including docs, instructional guides, and marketing communications.

# Page Structure Template

## 1. Hero Section

```markdown
# [Starter Kit Name] Starter Kit

[One-sentence value proposition describing what the starter kit does and its primary use case]. [Second sentence explaining the technical foundation]. You can use this foundation to create [specific application examples]. See Demo
```

**Example:**

> Workflows Starter Kit is a production-ready tldraw template for building visual programming with node-based workflows. It handles the complex canvas interactions, connection routing, and execution systems while you focus on your domain logic. Use this foundation to create automation builders, AI agentic workflows, or visual scripting tools. See Demo

## 2. Try It Yourself

Always include an immediate, copy-pastable command:

````markdown
## Try it yourself

To build with a [starter kit name], run this command in your terminal:

```javascript
npm create tldraw@latest my-[template-name]-app --template [template-name]
```
````

## 3. Use Cases

Present 3-5 specific use cases that showcase the starter kit's versatility. Each use case should be concrete and actionable:

```markdown
## 4. Use Cases

The [starter kit name] is perfect for building:

- **[Use Case Category]**: [Specific description of what developers can build, with real-world examples]
- **[Use Case Category]**: [Specific description with concrete applications]
- **[Use Case Category]**: [Technical application area with examples]
- **[Use Case Category]**: [Domain-specific use case with clear benefits]
- **[Use Case Category]**: [Advanced or specialized application]
```

**Guidelines for Use Cases:**

- **Be specific** - Instead of "data visualization," write "interactive dashboard builders for real-time analytics"
- **Focus on outcomes** - What will developers be able to create?
- **Vary complexity** - Mix simple and advanced use cases
- **Stay technical** - Avoid marketing language, focus on capabilities

## 5. How It Works

Break down the technical architecture into 3-5 core systems. Use numbered subsections with descriptive names and include a visual flowchart:

`````markdown
## How it works

The [starter kit] builds on tldraw's extensible architecture with [X] core systems working together:

```mermaid
[Flowchart]
```

```

### 1. [System Name]: [Brief Description]

[Explain the first core system with technical details and a simple code example]

### 2. [System Name]: [Brief Description]

[Continue with remaining systems...]

```

**Pattern:**

- **Start with flowchart** - Include a step-by-step Mermaid diagram showing user workflow or how the architecture works together
- **System explanations** - Each subsection explains what the system does and how it integrates with tldraw
- **Code examples** - Include small code snippets that illustrate each concept. Make sure they are correct.

**Flowchart Guidelines:**

- Use emojis to make steps visually distinct
- Show decision points with diamond shapes `{ðŸ¤” Question?}`
- Include start/end states with rounded rectangles `([ðŸŽ¯ Start])`
- Use colors to group related actions (user actions vs system responses)
- Keep the flow logical and match the actual user experience
- Replace `[Custom tool]` with the actual tool name from your starter kit

## 6. Tools/Interactions Section

List the specific tools or interactions enabled this starter kit provides:

```markdown
### [Starter Kit] Tools

This starter kit comes with [number] additional tools: [list them].

- **[Tool Name]**. [Brief description of what it does].
- **[Tool Name]**. [Brief description of what it does].

### [Starter Kit] Interactions

This kit enables [domain]-specific interactions out of the box.

#### [Interaction Name]

[Description of how the interaction works]
```

## 7. Customization Section (The Heart of the Page)

This is the most important section. This section has two goals:

1. Give users ideas on what can be customized (and where to find it)
2. Help completely new users quickly build tldraw mental model and vocabulary (so they can more easily understand how things work and ask better questions)
   Follow this exact pattern for each customization topic:

````markdown
## Customization

This starter kit is built on top of tldraw's extensible architecture, which means that everything can be customized. The canvas renders using React DOM, so you can use familiar React patterns, components, and state management across your [domain] interface. Let's have a look at some ways to change this starter kit.

### [Customization Topic Name]

To [describe what this customization achieves], [explain the technical approach]. [Explain how this integrates with tldraw's architecture and why it works this way].

See `[specific-file-path.tsx]` as an example. [Describe what the developer will see in that file and how it demonstrates the concept being discussed].

In the code example below, we [describe what the code example shows]:

```typescript
// [Clear comment explaining what this code does]
[Complete, working code example that developers can copy and modify -- make sure it is correct]
```

```

[Optional: Additional explanation if the code needs context]

```

**Critical Pattern Elements:**

1. **File Reference First** - Always point to real code in the repository
2. **Bridge Phrase** - "The code example below shows..." connects file reference to code
3. **Complete Code** - Never show partial snippets; always complete, runnable examples
4. **Comments** - Include helpful comments in code examples

## 8. Benefits Section

List 4-5 key benefits using this format:

```markdown
## Benefits

- **[Benefit Name]**: [Specific technical explanation of the benefit].
- **[Benefit Name]**: [Specific technical explanation of the benefit].
```
````
`````

## 9. Further Reading Section

Always end with 3 relevant topics for deeper learning -- pages from the docs, Examples, or blog.

```markdown
## Further reading

**[Topic Name]**: Learn how to [specific learning objective related to the starter kit].

**[Topic Name]**: Learn more about [related technical concept].

**[Topic Name]**: Learn how to [advanced use case or extension].
```

Writing Guidelines

Refer to the @MARKETING_STYLE_GUIDE.md for guidance on your language and style.

## Voice and Tone

- **Audience**: Senior React developers new to canvas applications
- **Voice**: Knowledgeable colleague, not teacher or salesperson
- **Tone**: Confident, technical, matter-of-fact
- **Avoid**: Marketing buzzwords ("seamless," "powerful," "sophisticated")
- **Use**: Specific, concrete technical language

## Technical Accuracy Requirements

**Before publishing, always:**

1. **Verify file paths** - Every `src/path/file.tsx` reference must exist
2. **Test code examples** - All code snippets must be functional when copied
3. **Check exports** - Ensure referenced methods/classes are actually exported
4. **Validate examples** - Confirm described use cases work as stated

## Code Example Standards

- **Start simple** - Show the most basic working example first
- **Progress logically** - Build complexity gradually
- **Include context** - Add comments for non-obvious code
- **Use TypeScript** - All examples must be properly typed
- **Complete examples** - Never show partial classes or incomplete functions
- **Real-world relevant** - Examples should solve actual developer problems

## File Reference Pattern

For every customization section:

1. **Point to specific files** in the repository (not directories unless showing multiple examples)
2. **Explain what developers will see** in those files
3. **Connect file examples to code snippets** with bridge phrases
4. **Use present tense** - "This file shows..." not "This file would show..."

## Language Guidelines

- **Define tldraw terms** on first use: "shape utilities (classes that define shape behavior)"
- **Assume React knowledge** - Don't explain hooks, props, components
- **Be specific** - Instead of "handles data," write "manages API responses and caching"
- **Use active voice** - "The system tracks relationships" not "Relationships are tracked"
- **Vary sentence length** but favor clarity over complexity

## Quality Checklist

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Broken Code Snippets** - Always test examples in actual development environment
2. **Missing File References** - Every customization topic needs a real file example
3. **Marketing Language** - Avoid promotional tone; stick to technical facts
4. **Incomplete Examples** - Don't show partial classes or methods without context
5. **Wrong File Paths** - Verify every `src/` path exists before publishing
6. **Missing Bridge Phrases** - Always connect file references to code examples
7. **Inconsistent Structure** - Every customization section must follow the same pattern
8. **Overly Complex Examples** - Start with the simplest working code, then build complexity

## Success Metrics

A successful starter kit documentation page:

- Enables developers to get working results within 5 minutes
- Provides clear customization paths for different skill levels
- Connects abstract concepts to concrete code examples
- Maintains technical accuracy while remaining approachable
- Guides developers from basic usage to advanced customization
- Serves as both tutorial and reference material

This approach creates documentation that serves both as learning material for newcomers and reference documentation for experienced developers building on the starter kit foundation.
