1. Read the source code in the provided directory.
2. Read the DOCS.md file in the provided directory.
3. Read the DOCS_STYLE_GUIDE.md file in the root directory.

Create or update the DOCS.md file in the provided directory, using the DOCS_STYLE_GUIDE.md as a guide. Be sure that your work is accurate to the source code in the file. If a DOCS.md already exists, update the DOCS.md file with the new information and double-check that the file is up to date and accurate to the source code.

At the top of the DOCS.md file, beneath the header, include a "Last updated" line that indicates the date of the last update to the file. It should follow this pattern:

```markdown
# Title of the page

This document was last updated: 2025-12-31
